### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ˜„ I moved to Github ;)

ðŸ”­ I develop mostly in Lua (gmod) and JS (node). Decided to start learning Py, which is a good language by the way)

ðŸ“« I use only discord and mail for communication.

ðŸ’¬ You can write me for ordering GMod addon/nodejs based site/Discord or Telegram bot or just for communication if you don't know who to play with.
